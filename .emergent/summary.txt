<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user's primary goal is to migrate their existing React application into a native Shopify theme. This theme must be a **1:1 visual and functional clone** of the original site. The AI assistant functionality from the original site also needs to be ported to the new Shopify theme. The user has expressed significant frustration due to multiple previous failed attempts by other agents.

PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:
1.  **Shopify Theme Migration:** Rebuild the entire React application as a native Shopify theme using Liquid. Embedding as a Shopify App is not an acceptable solution.
2.  **Visual and Functional Parity:** The Shopify theme must be indistinguishable from the React application in terms of layout, styling, animations, and responsiveness.
3.  **AI Assistant Integration:** The AI Assistant, including the secret code , must be fully functional in the new theme.
4.  **Language:** All text must be in Russian, managed via Shopify's locale files (though the current implementation has hardcoded text).

**User's preferred language**:
The user communicates in Ukrainian. The next agent **MUST** respond in **Ukrainian**.

**what currently exists?**
- A complete, functional React/FastAPI application which serves as the source of truth.
- A partially built Shopify theme located at . The current approach uses a static, pre-built TailwindCSS v2 stylesheet () after the Tailwind Play CDN caused major performance issues.
- The theme structure includes the main , , and approximately 16 section files () for the homepage.
- Placeholder templates and sections for secondary pages (Services, About, Portfolio, Contact) have been created, but they are not fully populated with content.
- Fixes for background color and some button styles have been partially implemented.

**Last working item**:
- **Last item agent was working:** The agent was addressing user feedback on the latest version of the theme. The user reported: 1) incorrect background, 2) non-functional buttons, 3) only the homepage works, 4) missing animations and effects. The agent began fixing this by adding custom CSS for missing colors, creating placeholder templates for other pages, and—problematically—adding inline styles to some components to fix button colors.
- **Status:** IN PROGRESS
- **Agent Testing Done:** N
- **Which testing method agent to use?** Create a  archive for the user to perform manual testing by uploading it to their Shopify store.
- **User Testing Done:** Y (User tested the previous version and provided a clear bug report).

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
- **Issue 1:** Shopify Theme is not a 1:1 visual and functional clone (P0)
- **Issue 2:** AI Assistant is non-functional in the Shopify theme (P1)
- **Issue 3:** Secondary pages are incomplete (P1)

**Issues Detail**:
- **Issue 1: Shopify Theme is not a 1:1 visual and functional clone**
    - **Attempted fixes:** Switched from Tailwind CDN to a static CSS file to resolve page freezes. Added custom CSS for  and  colors. Updated  to apply the correct background gradient. Started adding inline styles to buttons, which is a poor long-term solution.
    - **Next debug checklist:**
        1.  **Refactor Inline Styles:** Remove the inline  attributes from , , and . Replace them with dedicated CSS classes in  for maintainability.
        2.  **Fix Button Interactivity:** The user reported not all buttons work. This points to a JavaScript issue. Review  to ensure all event listeners (for tabs, mobile menus, etc.) are correctly implemented and attached.
        3.  **Restore Animations:** The user stated not all effects and animations are present. Review the  logic in  and compare it against the original site's CSS () to ensure all , , and other animations are correctly applied as elements scroll into view.
    - **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?** This is the user's primary requirement. Solving this is critical to regaining user trust.
    - **Status:** IN PROGRESS
    - **Is recurring issue?** Y
    - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Frontend (via user upload of the zip archive).
    - **Blocked on other issue:** None.

- **Issue 2: AI Assistant is non-functional in the Shopify theme**
    - **Attempted fixes:** An  section exists, but the JavaScript logic is incomplete.
    - **Next debug checklist:**
        1.  Port the  API call logic from  to .
        2.  Ensure the JavaScript correctly handles the secret code phrase .
        3.  Implement the logic to manage and display the conversation history in the UI.
    - **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?** Restores a key interactive feature from the original site.
    - **Status:** NOT STARTED
    - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Frontend.
    - **Blocked on other issue:** Issue 1. The main theme structure and functionality should be stable first.

- **Issue 3: Secondary pages are incomplete**
    - **Attempted fixes:** Created template files (, , etc.) and basic  sections for them.
    - **Next debug checklist:**
        1.  Flesh out the content for each secondary page (, , , ). This requires creating and including the necessary sections beyond just the hero banner, replicating the structure of the original React routes.
    - **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?** Addresses the user's report that only the homepage works.
    - **Status:** IN PROGRESS
    - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Frontend.
    - **Blocked on other issue:** None.

**In progress Task List**:
- **Task 1: Complete User-Reported Bug Fixes (P0)**
    - **Where to resume:** The previous agent was adding inline styles. The next agent should **stop** this approach and refactor those styles into the main  file. Then, proceed to fix the button interactivity (JS) and missing animations (JS/CSS). Finally, build out the content for the secondary pages.
    - **What will be achieved with this?** A much more complete and stable version of the theme that directly addresses all points from the user's latest feedback.
    - **Status:** IN PROGRESS
    - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Frontend.
    - **Blocked on something:** Nothing.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
**Upcoming Tasks:**
-   **P0:** Complete the 1:1 Shopify Theme migration, fixing all visual and functional bugs (encompasses all current issues).
-   **P1:** Fully implement the AI Assistant functionality.

**Future Tasks:**
-   Add email notifications for new leads to the admin panel.
-   Perform a full performance audit on the Shopify theme if the user reports speed issues.

**Completed work in this session**
-   Created a full skeleton for a Shopify theme with ~16 sections.
-   Switched from the problematic Tailwind Play CDN to a static, pre-built CSS file to fix performance freezes.
-   Created placeholder templates for secondary pages.
-   Partially fixed background and button color issues.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **Shopify Themes 2.0:** Using JSON templates and sections.
-   **Liquid:** Shopify's templating language.
-   **TailwindCSS v2:** Used via a static, pre-built CSS file in .
-   **JavaScript :** Used for scroll-triggered animations.

**All files of reference**
-   **Source of Truth:**  (especially  and ).
-   **Work in Progress:** The entire  directory.
-   **Key files to fix:** , , and any section with hardcoded inline styles (, , ).

**Areas that need refactoring**:
-   The use of inline  attributes for colors in , , and  must be removed. These should be replaced with custom CSS classes in  to ensure maintainability.

**key api endpoints**
-   : Required for the AI Assistant implementation.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   **User trust is extremely low due to multiple past failures.** Proceed with a clear, methodical plan. Do not declare the task complete until the theme is a true 1:1 clone.
-   **The strategy is to use a static TailwindCSS v2 file plus custom CSS.** Do not revert to the CDN.
-   **Address all of the user's latest feedback:** fix the buttons (JS), missing pages (content), and animations (JS/CSS).
-   **Refactor the inline styles** into proper CSS classes. This is a crucial code quality fix.
-   After implementing fixes, package the theme into  and provide the download link for user testing.
-   **Communicate exclusively in Ukrainian.**

**Last 10 User Messages and any pending HUMAN messages**
-   **User (latest):** Its better, but our background is missing, also not all buttons work, and in general only the main page works, fix this moment, also not all effects and animations." - This is the primary work order.
-   **User:** "this error pops up all the time" - Reported a "Page Unresponsive" error, which led to removing the Tailwind CDN.
-   **User:** "exported the site but when I go into the theme the page doesnt respond - Initial report of the theme being broken.
-   **User:** yes give me a link - Requesting the zip file for testing.
-   **User:** 1. yes 2. for now the public part 3. I want the whole thing as it is to be in shopify, so that there are no changes at all - Explicit confirmation of the 1:1 cloning requirement.

**Project Health Check:**
-   **React App:** Healthy
-   **Shopify Theme:** **Broken.** While it loads, it suffers from significant visual (background, animations) and functional (broken buttons, missing pages) bugs that prevent it from being a viable clone.

**3rd Party Integrations**
-   **OpenAI GPT-4o-mini:** Used for the AI Assistant. This needs to be re-implemented using JavaScript's  API within the Shopify theme's .

**Testing status**
-   **Test files created:** None.
-   **Known regressions:** The user's latest test has confirmed multiple regressions from the original React site's functionality and appearance.

**Credentials to test flow:**
-   **AI Code Word:** 
-   **Admin Login:** 
-   **Admin Password:** 

**What agent forgot to execute**
-   The previous agent did not fully fix all reported bugs. It created placeholder files for pages without adding content and used a brittle inline-style approach for fixing colors instead of a robust CSS class-based solution. The work was left incomplete before packaging and sending to the user for the next round of verification.</analysis>
