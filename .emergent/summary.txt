**User's preferred language**:
The user communicates in Ukrainian and Russian. The user has requested the website content to be in **Russian**. The next agent should respond in **Ukrainian**.

**what currently exists?**
A multi-page React frontend application has been built, cloning the layout of . The application uses mock data and has been restyled according to the user's color and language preferences. It features six distinct pages: Home, About, Services, Portfolio, Resources, and Contact. All interactive elements like navigation, modals, and forms are functional on the frontend, with form submissions showing toast notifications.

**Last working item**:
-   **Last item agent was working:** The agent started implementing the user's latest request by adding an animated background. It created a new component  and integrated it into the main  file.
-   **Status:** IN PROGRESS
-   **Agent Testing Done:** N
-   **Which testing method agent to use?** screenshot tool. Use the tool against  to verify that the animated background renders correctly and doesn't disrupt the existing layout.
-   **User Testing Done:** N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
There are no known bugs or issues. The pending work consists of feature requests.

**In progress Task List**:

-   **Task 1: Complete implementation of the latest user request (P0)**
    -   **Where to resume:** The files for the animated background (, , ) have been created. The immediate next step is to start the frontend server and use the screenshot tool to verify the background appears as expected.
    -   **What will be achieved with this?** The website will be enhanced with an animated background, a floating effect for content blocks, significantly more content, and an updated, detailed list of services as per the user's request.
    -   **Status:** IN PROGRESS
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Frontend
    -   **Blocked on something:** No

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**

**Upcoming Tasks:**
-   **(P0) Make content blocks float above the background:** Apply CSS (, , etc.) to all main content sections on every page to create a visual effect of depth over the new animated background.
-   **(P0) Add 5x more information:** Substantially expand the content within . This will involve adding more projects to the portfolio, more articles to the resources, more testimonials, and more descriptive text throughout the site.
-   **(P0) Implement the new list of 12 services:**
    -   Update  to replace the old services with the new list of 12 services provided by the user.
    -   For each service, add the corresponding gift information.
    -   Modify  and any related components to display this new structure.
-   **(P1) Refactor component file extensions:** Rename  component files (, ) to  for consistency with the rest of the project.

**Future Tasks:**
-   **Backend Integration:** Once the frontend is finalized and approved, the next major phase would be to connect it to a real backend. This will involve:
    1.  Defining API contracts in a  file.
    2.  Developing FastAPI endpoints and MongoDB models for handling form submissions (contact, quotes), portfolio data, and resources.
    3.  Replacing mock data and simulated form submissions in the React application with actual API calls.

**Completed work in this session**
-   **UI Clone:** Created a frontend clone of  adapted for the duso_ecom brand.
-   **Language & Theming:**
    -   Changed all website content to Russian.
    -   Implemented a new color scheme: orange (), emerald (), black, and white.
-   **Multi-Page Architecture:** Converted the application from a single page to a 6-page site (, , , , , ).
-   **Interactive Frontend:** Implemented functional UI elements including navigation, modals for quotes and calls, portfolio filters, resource filters, and contact forms with toast notifications.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
-   None.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
-   None.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **Frontend:** React, React Router, TailwindCSS, shadcn/ui.
-   **Backend:** FastAPI, MongoDB (template provided, but not yet integrated).
-   **Data:** All content is currently mocked in a central  file.

**key DB schema**
-   Not yet applicable. The backend database schema has not been designed.

**changes in tech stack**
-   None.

**All files of reference**
-   : The new component for the animated background.
-   : The main application component, updated to include the animated background and routing.
-   : Contains custom styles, including those for the new background.
-   : The source of all content. This file will need significant updates for the upcoming tasks.
-   : Directory containing all page components that structure the website.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
-   Several components were created with a  extension (e.g., ). For consistency, they should be renamed to .

**key api endpoints**
-   None implemented. The application is frontend-only.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   The user's most recent request is large and only partially started. You must first verify the animated background, then proceed to the other parts of the request (floating blocks, more content, new services).
-   **Testing:** The external preview URL has been unreliable. Use  or the screenshot tool targeting  for reliable testing and verification.
-   The content of the website must be in **Russian**, and the specified color scheme (orange, emerald, black, white) must be maintained.

**documents and test reports created in this job**
-   None.

**Last 10 User Messages and any pending HUMAN messages**
1.  **User (Message 121):** looks cool, but make separate pages on the site so that it is not a single page, and make more information, also all buttons must work exclusively
    -   **Status: Completed.** The agent successfully converted the site to a multi-page structure and verified button functionality.
2.  **User (Message 162):** replace the site background with some animated one, but in dark colors, also make it so that all the blocks seem to float above the background, also make 5x more information on the site, also these should be the services... [12 services listed] ... also add gifts to these services that are included...
    -   **Status: In Progress.** This is the current active request. Only the animated background part has been started.

**Project Health Check:**
-   **Broken:** The external preview URL is unreliable. Local testing is required.
-   **Mocked:** The entire application is mocked. All data comes from a local file, and form submissions are simulated.

**3rd Party Integrations**
-   None.

**Testing status**
-   **Testing agent used after significant changes:** NO
-   **Troubleshoot agent used after agent stuck in loop:** NO
-   **Test files created:** None
-   **Known regressions:** None

**Credentials to test flow:**
-   Not applicable.

**What agent forgot to execute**
-   The majority of the user's last request from message #162 is pending:
    -   Implementing the floating effect for content blocks.
    -   Adding 5x more content to the site.
    -   Updating the services list and adding the associated gifts.
-   The agent did not maintain a consistent  file extension for all React components.</analysis>
