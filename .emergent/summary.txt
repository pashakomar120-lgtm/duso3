<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user's initial goal was to fix several bugs to make the website work like a Swiss watch. This involved fixing page navigation scrolling, a  error on the contact page, an AI assistant UI bug, improving the AI's intelligence, and making buttons on the Resources page functional.

This has since evolved into a series of major feature additions and a new set of requirements:
1.  **Admin Panel:** Create a full admin panel with JWT authentication to view leads, chat history, and client interactions submitted through the website's forms.
2.  **Secret Access:** Implement a secret code word in the AI assistant that reveals the admin login page, and create a highly secure, non-obvious login and password.
3.  **Content Expansion (5x):** Massively increase the number of portfolio projects and testimonials, and add domains for projects from various CIS countries.
4.  **UI/UX Enhancements:** Add a WOW-factor block with client logos on the homepage and replace text placeholders with actual flag images for all country mentions across the site (header, portfolio filters, content blocks).
5.  **Current Request:**
    *   Make the entire website, including the new admin panel, fully responsive and adaptive for all devices (mobile, tablet, desktop).
    *   Conduct a full audit to ensure all text on the site is in Russian.
    *   Reposition or redesign the Need help? live chat widget.
    *   Address the Shopify theme compatibility issue, specifically the error 	zip warning: name not matched: not

	zip warning: name not matched: valid
	zip warning: name not matched: theme:
	zip warning: name not matched: missing

zip error: Nothing to do! (does.zip).

**User's preferred language**:
The user communicates in Ukrainian and Russian. The next agent MUST respond in **Ukrainian**.

**what currently exists?**
A highly complex and feature-rich full-stack application.
-   **Frontend:** A visually intensive React application featuring a WOW-effect design with animated backgrounds and glass-morphism. It includes a home page, about, services, an expanded portfolio (50+ projects), resources, contact, and legal pages. Key UI features include a functional AI assistant, a live chat widget, a WOW logo wall, and extensive use of flag imagery. An entire admin section () exists with a login page, a dashboard with statistics and graphs, and pages to view leads, calls, and chat conversations.
-   **Backend:** A FastAPI server with a MongoDB connection. It handles JWT-based authentication for the admin panel, provides all data for the admin dashboard, and saves data from the contact form, live chat, and AI conversations to the database. It also serves the AI assistant endpoint using .
-   **Secret Access:** A backdoor to the admin panel is implemented. Typing  into the AI assistant reveals a link to the admin login page.

**Last working item**:
-   **Last item agent was working:** The agent acknowledged the user's latest and most extensive request, which includes making the site fully responsive, ensuring all text is in Russian, repositioning the live chat, and making the project compatible with Shopify as a theme. The agent was preparing to start work on this multi-part task.
-   **Status:** NOT STARTED
-   **Agent Testing Done:** N
-   **Which testing method agent to use?** Frontend testing agent. The agent will need to test the UI across multiple device resolutions (mobile, tablet, desktop) for all pages, including the admin panel.
-   **User Testing Done:** N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
-   **Issue 1: Full Site & Admin Panel Responsiveness (P0)**
    -   **Description:** The user wants the entire application, from the public-facing pages to the admin dashboard, to be fully adaptive and look good on all devices.
    -   **Status:** NOT STARTED
-   **Issue 2: Shopify Theme Compatibility (P0)**
    -   **Description:** The user wants to upload the project ZIP as a Shopify theme but is getting the error 	zip warning: name not matched: not
	zip warning: name not matched: contain
	zip warning: name not matched: a
	zip warning: name not matched: valid
	zip warning: name not matched: theme:
	zip warning: name not matched: missing
	zip warning: name not matched: template
	zip warning: name not matched: layout/theme.liquid

zip error: Nothing to do! (does.zip). This is a fundamental architectural conflict, as a React application cannot be directly used as a Shopify Liquid theme.
    -   **Status:** NOT STARTED
-   **Issue 3: Internationalization (i18n) Audit (P1)**
    -   **Description:** The user wants to ensure that every piece of text on the website is in Russian. This requires a site-wide audit.
    -   **Status:** NOT STARTED
-   **Issue 4: Live Chat Position/Design (P2)**
    -   **Description:** The user is unhappy with the current position or implementation of the live chat widget and wants it changed.
    -   **Status:** NOT STARTED

    -   **Attempted fixes:** None.
    -   **Next debug checklist:** This is not a bug to be fixed but a major architectural task requiring user consultation.
        1.  **DO NOT** attempt to fix the zip file.
        2.  **MUST** explain to the user the technical limitations using . Explain that a React app and a Shopify Liquid theme are fundamentally different.
        3.  Propose the two valid paths forward:
            *   **Option A: Shopify App.** Keep the React application as is and embed it into Shopify stores as a Shopify App using an iframe. This is the most direct path.
            *   **Option B: Rebuild in Liquid.** Recreate the entire frontend from scratch using Shopify's native  templating language, , and JSON templates. This is a massive undertaking.
    -   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?** To align the project with the user's goal of deploying it on Shopify.
    -   **Status:** NOT STARTED
    -   **Is recurring issue?** Y
